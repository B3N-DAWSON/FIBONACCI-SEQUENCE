# WHAT WAS THE PROMPT FOR THIS PROJECT?

- I was reminded after browsing online of the Fibonacci Sequence and impulsively decided to design it as a very simple program to print the sequence.

- This project is very simple but the importance for me relies more on being able to complete a project I am impulsively decided to code.

# WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM

- This is a small program that prints out Fibonacci's numbers/sequence with the size of the user input value 
(e.g. inputting 7 returns seven Fibonacci numbers).

# WHAT DID I GAIN FROM THIS PROJECT?
- The purpose of this project was to help with familiarity of Python and experience as a programmer and the correct approach to take. It has also helped me to code up an idea I impulsively decided on trying to complete.
